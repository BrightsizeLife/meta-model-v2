## Data Quality Requirements

1. **Team Name Normalization**: All team names must use consistent naming (e.g., "Los Angeles Rams" not "LA Rams")
2. **No Missing Required Stats**: All statistical columns must have values (no NA), except where legitimately zero
3. **Type Consistency**: Integers for counts, strings for identifiers
4. **Season Coverage**: Complete coverage for all games in seasons 2023-2025

## Notes

- This schema is designed to be predictive, available from standard NFL sources, and uniform across seasons
- Defensive stats represent events allowed or generated by the defense
- Schema aligns with the goal 3 database schema specification in `docs/context/assets/goal 3 database schema.md`
